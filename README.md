# Personal Portfolio

This is my **Personal Portfolio** website, built using **React**, **Javascript** and **CSS**. This is my second Portfolio Website, that I created to replace my [old portfolio](https://github.com/CallumB04/old-portfolio).

I will continue to use this portfolio to showcase my Projects and new Languages / Skills as I progress as a Software Developer!

## Live Demo

You can view the live version of the Portfolio [here](https://callumb04.github.io).

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

## Future plans
- Add a unique page for each Project. Which will display images, technologies used, and information about the Project.
- Possible implementation of a blog section to showcase my learning journey.
